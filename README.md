# noteapp
This is a simple web application that sets notes. I wrote it in python using the flask framework.

It's very basic and the only reason I have it here is to document, or maybe improve it if I feel like it.
If for whatever reason you want to try it, then you'll have to install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file using the following command (assuming you have pip):
pip install -r requirements.txt
